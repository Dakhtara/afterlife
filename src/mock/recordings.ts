The label and events will complement each other with one  aim; to bring the crowd into another dimension of music perception with enthralling production to that ignite the senses.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The ‘Realm Of Consciousness’ voyage commences with Tale Of Us’ Lies – a fitting introduction with quivering keys and restrained percussion that engenders an ominous suspense ahead of Monoloc’s enigmatic industrial techno crunch, Phoenix. Shifting through the haunting chords of Recondite’s dynamic Murphy’s Law, to the brooding synth of Poseidon by Ukrainian duo Woo York, the realisation of Afterlife utopia is upon us. The repetitive, mesmerising synth and effective reverb that Somne creates with Triangle is an odyssey within itself. From there, John Hester’s expertly woven ‘Logan’ is a feverish techno stab that transverses through the emotional senses, transitioning to Locked Groove’s adroitly crafted Emeralds, to Ryan James Ford’s ambient, albeit percussive, techno cut Toree Bahrstad. Die Wiederkehr is the outcome of Obscure Shape & SHDW’s collaboration, which incorporates facets of techno and trance that have been shaped with real guile and finesse. Mind Against round off the compilation with Gravity – a mystifying ambience and a fitting title as we touch back down to planet earth.",

Inspired by the Ionian sea in Southern Italy, low-pitched basslines and soaring synths give the tracks just the right amount of drama, whilst the rich sound-design allows them to make the most of a big system; something Tale Of Us have put to great use in their sets this year.

Ending the record is ‘Natural Causes’, an entrancing trip through dreamy arpeggios that grooves up-and-down, taking the dancers with it.
